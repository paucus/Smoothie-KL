This Mass Storage Device is not real. It is a virtual device displayed by the Kikai Labs software to let you know that no external SD card was inserted in your printer. If you have already inserted it and you can't see it, you might wish to proceed reading this document to understand how to mount it properly. Otherwise, read the documentation at the Kikai Labs web site. 

HOW TO USE IT
*************
In order to mount an external SD card in the computer follow these steps:
* Unmount/Extract this Mass Storage Device from the computer.
* Unplug the USB cable from the computer.
* Insert an SD card into the SD reader slot.
* Using the LCD display, open the screen to select the file to print. While doing this, the printer will rescan for new SD cards.
  If you prefer, you can manually unmount and remount the SD card from your printer client. Most of the most popular clients allow you to do that.
  If your client doesn't have that capability, you can also manually run the M721 G-Code from a printer client in order to do the same.
