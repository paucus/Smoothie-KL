How to generate the Windows Installer
-------------------------------------
This post-processor requires python 2.7, vtk and PIL.
In order to generate the Post-processor installer, download these files:
* vtkpython-6.3.0-Windows-32bit.exe from http://www.vtk.org/download/
* PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
(PIL has been abandoned, so in the future it might be better to move to Pillow)
* nsis-2.49-setup.exe from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

vtkpython-6.3.0-Windows-32bit.exe is a whole python environment with vtk installed in it.
PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe is the installer for PIL. We are not interested in installing it on the vtk python. We just need to copy the library files.
nsis-2.49-setup.exe Is the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, an open source installer generator. It is responsible for generating the installer binary.

Once downloaded, follow these steps:
* Install vtkpython. The installation directory will be referenced as $VTKINSTALLDIR.
* For some reason vtkpython comes with vtk dlls from version 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. Delete *-6.1.dll and *-6.2.dll from the $VTKINSTALLDIR.
* Run in $VTKINSTALLDIR the following shell command:
$ python -m compileall -q python
This will precompile all py files inside the python directory (to speed up the loading process).
* Decompress PIL as if it was a zip file in a temporary folder ($PILTMP).
* Open PIL dir and move $PILTMP/PLATLIB/PIL inside $VTKINSTALLDIR/lib.
* Copy the vtk installation directory $VTKINSTALLDIR to the working directory where and rename it to "python".

Ubuntu Installation
-------------------
Run the following script:
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 vtk6 python-vtk6 python-pil
Troubleshooting
***************
If it throws:
> ImportError: No module named vtkCommonCorePython
In that case, you might need to fix some broken links. To fix them, run the following lines:
$ cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
$ for a in libvtk*-6.0.so.6.0;do sudo ln -s "$a" ${a/-6.0.so.6.0/-6.0.so};done
This has been reported to happen in Kubuntu 14.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
* Tkinter doesn't work in our Windows python installation. Dialogs won't be displayed.
